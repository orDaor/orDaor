ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Orgher. I am a software engineer with industrial automation background, which wants to learn the Web stack:

- ðŸ’» I had expirience with: **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Websockets (Socket.IO package), MongoDB, and a bit of MySQL**.

  - a **live messaging app** powered by Socket.IO
  - a tic-tac-toe **multipayer game**

  - More **SQL** databases
  - **React** frontend framework
